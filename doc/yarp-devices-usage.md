# Usage 

## AravisGigE device
To use this YARP device a GigE camera is required. Once connected, use the following commands to control the camera and receive images.

### Running the device
To run the device and connect to the camera, simply run:

`yarpdev --name AravisGigE`

If you want to test the device without an actual camera, you can use a fake Aravis camera:

`yarpdev --name AravisGigE --fake`

### Obtaining a color image from the device
This YARP device returns a raw 8-bit image from the camera, to obtain a color image from the image, the stream has to be connected using the [Bayer carrier ](http://www.yarp.it/carrier_config.html#carrier_config_bayer) to interpret the raw image as a RGB image. Given an `AravisGigE` device named `/grabber` and an input port named `/v` (from a viewer, for instance), the command to run to connect them is:

`yarp connect /grabber /v udp+recv.bayer+order.gbrg` 

### Camera parameters control
The control of the camera parameters is performed from the image port (`/grabber` by default ), through a [RPC interface](http://www.yarp.it/rpc_ports.html).

`yarp rpc /grabber`

Once there one can send command to the camera. The most common commands are: `has`, `get` and `set`. 

#### has
With the `has` command one can query the device if it has some property. For instance, to check if the camera has zoom controls:

`fgc2 has feat 16`

#### get
With the ' get' command one can query the *value* of some property. For instance, to check the current gain value:

`fgc2 get feat 9`

#### set 
With the `set` command one can change the *value* of some property. For instance, to set the zoom to the maximum value:

`fgc2 set feat 16 100`

#### Available features
These are the features currently available in YARP. To check which ones are supported by the camera, the `has` command can be used:

| Feature | Enum name | Enum value |
| --- | --- | ---| 
| Brightness | YARP_FEATURE_BRIGHTNESS | 0 |
| Exposure |YARP_FEATURE_EXPOSURE | 1 |
| Sharpness | YARP_FEATURE_SHARPNESS | 2 |
| White Balance | YARP_FEATURE_WHITE_BALANCE | 3 |
| Hue | YARP_FEATURE_HUE | 4 |
| Saturation | YARP_FEATURE_SATURATION | 5 |
| Gamma |YARP_FEATURE_GAMMA | 6 |
| Shutter |YARP_FEATURE_SHUTTER | 7 |
| Gain |YARP_FEATURE_GAIN | 8 |
| Iris |YARP_FEATURE_IRIS | 9 |
| Focus |YARP_FEATURE_FOCUS | 10 |
| Temperature |YARP_FEATURE_TEMPERATURE | 11 |
| Trigger |YARP_FEATURE_TRIGGER | 12 |
| Trigger delay |YARP_FEATURE_TRIGGER_DELAY | 13 |
| White Shading |YARP_FEATURE_WHITE_SHADING | 14 |
| Frame Rate |YARP_FEATURE_FRAME_RATE | 15 |
| Zoom | YARP_FEATURE_ZOOM | 16 |
| Pan |YARP_FEATURE_PAN | 17 |
| Tilt |YARP_FEATURE_TILT | 18 |

| Capture size | YARP_FEATURE_CAPTURE_SIZE | 20 |
| Capture quality | YARP_FEATURE_CAPTURE_QUALITY | 21 |
| Mirror | YARP_FEATURE_MIRROR | 22 |
| Number of features | YARP_FEATURE_NUMBER_OF | 23 |

### FAQ
#### I can receive an image, but it is all dark, what can I do?

This is probably due to a bad configuration of the camera parameters. Try to increase the gain or exposure until the image starts looking brighter. For the 1.0.B06 lab, some values that work great are:

```
Gain: 10
Exposure: 32000
````

#### I cannot receive a color image, but I receive a grey image with a regular point pattern on it.

What you are receiving is the raw image of the camera. To obtain a color image from it you need to decode it using a Bayer filter. Follow the steps in the section [Obtaining a color image from the device](#obtaining-a-color-image-from-the-device) in this very same guide to fix it.

## GrabberControls2GuiGUI program

To use the GrabberControls2GuiGUI you will need to be already running an instance of yarpserver and AravisGigE device. Once both are up and running, you can simply call the GrabberControls2GuiGUI:

```bash
GrabberControls2GuiGUI
```

By default it will try to connect to `/grabber`. If the port for the AravisGigE device is not `/grabber`, you can specify it when launching the `GrabberControls2GuiGUI`:

```bash
GrabberControls2GuiGUI --remote-port /whatever_port_you_want
```
